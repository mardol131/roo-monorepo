# Project Context and Coding Guidelines

Always try to create components and modules, when it makes sense. Avoid large monolithic files.

Always use colors from the design system or defined in the global styles. Do not use hardcoded color values.
Prefer using utility functions and shared components over duplicating code.
When naming variables, functions, classes, and components, use clear and descriptive names that convey their purpose. It is ok if they are longer when needed for clarity.
When creating React components, prefer functional components and hooks over class components.
When writing TypeScript, always define types and interfaces for props, state, and function signatures to ensure type safety and improve code readability.
When creating new files, ensure they follow the existing project structure and naming conventions.
Use kebab-case for file names and folder names.
Dont use <strong>
Dont use <img>, only <Image> from next/image
Use only icons from lucide-icons package, dont use text-based emojis.
Nepoužívat textové ikony.
